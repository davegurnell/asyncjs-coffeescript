    - Coffeescript
      - Coffeescript is an alternative syntax for JS
      - It has a nice syntax
      - It's great for functional programming (which is important !!)
        - Who "gets" what FP is?
      - Why you should care:
        - It gives you advanced language features without worrying
          about cross-browser support
