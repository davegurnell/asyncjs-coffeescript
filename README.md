## Abstract

Javascript is a great programming language marred by idiosyncratic flaws. Odd [semantic quirks][] and [inconsistencies][] in browser implementations combine with verbose syntax to make coding difficult and error-prone. While [forthcoming versions][] will address these flaws, many of us will be maintaining support for existing web browsers well into the future.

Enter [Coffeescript][] - a lightweight syntactic wrapper that compiles to Javascript and is available for production use right now. Coffeescript, which has been the topic of [previous talks][] at Async, aims to help developers improve their Javascript by making "good" code easier to write.

[Dave Gurnell][] has been writing Javascript since the Netscape days and currently uses Coffeescript as an indispensable part of his production toolchain. In this talk, Dave will provide a short introduction to Coffeescript syntax before launching into an in-depth analysis of its most valuable features and biggest drawbacks. He will touch on tools for building and testing code, as well as discussing what *he* believes to be good coding style and inviting you to disagree with him vociferously.

Dave is co-founder of A/B testing startup [Myna][] and a director at software development consultancy [Underscore][]. His current utility belt includes [Scala][], [Akka][] and [Play][] on the server and [Coffeescript][], [Underscore.js][], and [Backbone.js][] on the client. He lives in Hove and likes synthesizers.
